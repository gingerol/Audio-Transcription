0	5000	So, can you tell me what you think about the story and the experience you had in VR?
5000	7000	The last time we came here was...
7000	9000	I think...
9000	13000	I saw a man going on to a box
13000	16000	And all the stuff that we were seeing
16000	19000	So the world was outside there
19000	23000	And the 13-inch is the outside light
23000	25000	And the outside voice
25000	29000	And the vocalist...
29000	30000	Okay.
32000	35000	There was a music, so the touch I came in
35000	39000	Now we are here at the New Year's training
39000	43000	So they say yes, what is the new student at Galba?
43000	47000	They are on the name to guide you
49000	51000	So...
51000	54000	So what do you think about every single day?
55000	59000	That time was...
61000	63000	In the box
63000	66000	They are swimming to pick them up
68000	71000	And we came into the class
71000	74000	So let's add a little bit of this box
74000	76000	So they want...
76000	78000	They want to learn
78000	80000	They are taught in the piano
80000	82000	And they are not...
82000	84000	That is...
84000	85000	That is...
85000	88000	And they are taught in the piano
88000	92000	So what do you think about this story?
92000	94000	What do you think about this story?
96000	98000	You can't go into the shows
98000	100000	And the people in the...
100000	102000	Those are the classmates of the school
102000	104000	Why do you think they were treating like that?
104000	107000	Because they are always happy
107000	111000	They are vocalists who feel out of the piano
113000	115000	So what part of the story touched you?
125000	127000	I don't know, I learned this
129000	131000	I learned a lot of stuff from me
131000	133000	What kind of touch you like?
133000	135000	You have it in the upper part of your piano
136000	138000	I don't like the way they treat you
138000	140000	Which part of the class is that?
142000	143000	I don't know
143000	145000	That which part of the class
145000	147000	That of the teachers
147000	149000	As they are using
149000	151000	Yes, that part of the school
152000	156000	So how do you think that you put yourself in your class position?
156000	158000	I fell soon
160000	162000	So when you were in that room
162000	164000	You felt like you should do that
165000	167000	So since that time you had the experience
167000	168000	In VR
168000	172000	Can you tell me a story of how you are really seeing somebody from another
172000	174000	That child is different from yours
176000	178000	So that's that
178000	180000	And we have any interaction
180000	182000	We have any relationship
183000	186000	Interaction with people from another child
186000	187000	That is different
188000	190000	I don't know
190000	193000	You know, I thought that you put them outside
193000	195000	So you have to try
197000	199000	So what has changed to you?
199000	200000	Can you add the experience?
200000	201000	Like the tissue lens?
201000	203000	What are we doing to you?
204000	206000	I learned
208000	211000	I learned this from the girl that they say
211000	213000	Dosa too
213000	215000	I don't need a Dosa too
215000	219000	I don't need a Dosa too
219000	220000	I don't need a Dosa
221000	222000	You need a Dosa too
223000	225000	I don't need a Dosa anymore
227000	228000	I don't need a Dosa anymore
229000	231000	It's the notes that they say
233000	234000	So if you're not asking me or not
236000	237000	As I said, go and act
238000	240000	That's what I mean
243000	243500	You know, you see somebody
244000	245000	It's right here
245000	247000	When you say you see somebody, Nidasa
247000	248000	See, it's chive
249000	251000	I see.
251000	255000	This is somebody being cheated, but because of the choice.
255000	257000	What would you do?
257000	259000	I really am.
259000	261000	I hope this is the product.
261000	265000	I hope this is the product.
265000	269000	So you really need to be cheated.
269000	273000	Yeah, because it's the cheetah factor.
279000	285000	So if you find somebody that is not cheated by the pedestrian church, what would you do?
285000	287000	I will go with one little boy.
287000	288000	You go with one little girl.
288000	291000	Yeah, from the person who got cheated by the pedestrian church.
291000	296000	The person that's cheated by the highway for the pedestrian church.
296000	298000	It's always cheated by the pedestrian church.
298000	300000	Not for the roadmits.
300000	304000	Oh, he's actually cheating somebody on the street.
304000	305000	Because it's a church.
305000	327000	If you find somebody that you find a situation where they actually use somebody but they are discriminates and they give you this because of the passing struggle.
327000	337000	But all you do is I will provide that destination.
337000	347000	But there is pity but I don't like the weather there is pity but I don't like the weather there is pity but
