00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
So can you tell me what you think about the story in the experience you had in

00:04.560 --> 00:08.000
VR the last time you came?

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
I saw a man boy went to a box and all the students came to the abusing room.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
So the boy was a Hausa boy.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
And we were told that the Hausa boy is a Boko Haram.

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
So the teacher came in and asked what the new student's name was.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
They turned the name to Gary.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
So what do you think about everything that happened?

00:55.000 --> 01:06.000
Later in the box, in the box they told him to pick one bud.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
He picked him and entered the class.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So later, they later do sports.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So they went one to one.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
They told him that he cannot run, that he is a thing that he wants to run for life.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
So that was it.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So why do you think they did all of these things to him?

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Because they want to show us.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Like the people in the school, why do you think they were treating him like that?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Because he is a Hausa boy.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
They are Boko Haram.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
They used to feed a lot of people.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
So what part of the story touched you the most?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I learned a lot of things.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I learned a lot of stories from him.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
What part touched you the most?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Amongst all the things they did to him.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't like the way they treated him.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Which particular things?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Hausa.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Like which particular type of treatment?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
As they abused him.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
The way they abused him?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yes.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
That part touched you?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yes.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So how do you think he felt?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
If you put yourself in your reverse position, how do you feel about it?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I felt so bad.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So when you were in the experience, it felt like it was you.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yes.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
So since that time you had the experience in VR, can you tell me a story of how you have been relating with somebody from another tribe that is different from yours?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Yes.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't understand what you are saying.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
Have you had any interaction with people from another tribe that is different from yours?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
No.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
So you don't talk to people that are not from another tribe?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
No.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I talk to everybody.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Hausa, Yoruba, I don't have a child.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So you relate to everybody?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yes.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
So what has changed since you had that experience?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Like the things you learned, what have you been doing differently?

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
I learned good from the boy that they said Hausa.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
So I don't hear the Hausa too much.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Because they tell them that they are Yoruba.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So you believe that they are Yoruba?

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't believe Yoruba. I want to ask a person beside me.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
You want to ask?

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
Another person beside me. So I have not seen the Hausa. Maybe I was attracted. Is it true that you are Yoruba?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yes.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
So when you ask, you know that you are Yoruba?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
Alright. So if you see somebody that is discriminated against or treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
If I see...

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
If you see somebody being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I will...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I will go away from them.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
So you will leave the person that is discriminated against?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Because he is treated badly.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So if you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I will go away from them.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
You will go away from them?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
From the person that is treating them badly?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
The person that is treated badly.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
You will go away from the person?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yes.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Why?

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Because if you see somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
If they are treating somebody badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Because this guy is being treated badly.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I don't understand.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
If you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
You will feel bad.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Why would you do that?

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
I will advise that person that he should go away from the person that is being treated badly.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Why would you do that?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Because they are being treated badly.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I don't like the way that they are being treated badly.
