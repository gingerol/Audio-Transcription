So she is
One last question about the experience we had with him two months ago
first I think
So let's start by celebrating your name, your age and your class.
Okay, my name is Alabi Shikbo, Miracle Rala.
I am 14 years old and SS3.
Okay, so do you remember the story?
Can you give it back to your reality?
Oh, you don't need to remember the detail or you remember the story.
Yeah, I remember about Funkai and Adal and how Adal.
What is Funkai?
Funkai of Funkai.
What tribe was she?
The Irbapun.
I can remember the Irbapun.
I tried it.
Yes, she was.
She sent it to me.
Yes.
Eh?
She's remembering.
That's what it is.
Okay.
Okay, so what's the Niger Delta, right?
Do you remember her name?
I can't remind you.
Ulyoga.
I know that was one complex name, yeah.
So what do you think about it?
What do you think about what happened?
Like, it's very peaceful.
How she lost her father by the beat scene and the old tribalism and everything.
And I wanted to encourage her if I were there.
That she has to be resilient.
That sometimes life throws us challenges.
And we need to tone them to opportunities to be a better person.
Yeah.
You said you wanted to encourage her if you were there.
But were you not there?
I was there.
Well, you know, it's not...
It's not like...
It's a virtual reality someday.
But it's not actually real.
It's not someone that can walk up to and see this.
But the letter I was giving to, right?
I stated there that she should not lay down.
We are down.
She should remember the girl her father wants her to be.
I wouldn't do her father in her life.
Her father wants to see a better lady.
Independent lady.
Great from her.
So I wanted to encourage her.
You have to be resilient.
You have to move forward in life.
No matter that.
You say when life throws you lemon, you make lemon in it.
And I wanted to explain that to her which I did in my letter.
Who were you in the story?
In the story?
I was actually her.
What do you think I made you think you were her?
In the...
It's like the virtual reality.
There were some things I would ask to press.
Using that and then...
Yeah, the contrary.
Yeah, I gave...
Like when I was still in particular.
When she entered the new school.
And she was in the restroom dressing.
When she was facing the mirror.
Anyhow I did my heart.
This...
That's all I knew there.
That's all I knew me.
Who's missing?
You were able to tell me how many years I spent.
See, she felt very bad.
Like, she had...
She had come to that school with a lot of expectations.
Like, she...
She's not something she imagined that I put.
She wasn't expecting anybody to bully her or say things like that.
But I also said it.
And you know, when she's just coming out from a bad situation
and she's facing another one.
But the two situations sums up together.
And make her feel very...
All I say, she feels very discouraged.
And she thinks her whole hope is lost.
And that's the very bad and pitiful thing for a person to feel.
Either me or you'll go any other person.
The most touching part.
The...
Like, it touched me...
Was when a father was beaten up.
Like, you know, I'm a type of person that...
I can't see something but up in and I'll keep quiet.
If it's within my boundary, I'll make sure that I do my utmost best
to ensure that stuff.
So, when I was in this reality game,
I also argued about how you'll be beaten.
But like, after all, it's a retro reality.
It's not something.
But I was seeping that, if I were dead,
there wouldn't have to be beaten up the way it was.
And I hit the father.
When...
The William Ganada was rushing for safety.
The woman didn't open the door for the father.
Yeah, in a way, she was trying to protect herself.
But at least, she could have...
I know that she could have called people.
People not helped him.
No, but I live in the mall yet.
It's a bit of a stupid and dead.
And I just felt so bad about that.
So, since that time, you came alone.
I'm a proficient.
I'd ask you for your school.
I reminded you of the year of the same thing around you.
Let me be truthful.
I've never had that type of experience before.
Because I feel in my school,
everybody knows their boundaries.
There are some things they can't do.
Because we have laws in the school.
And then, and again, we even signed up on that taking in this school.
So, if any of the reasons being...
You get punished, too.
So, if you see someone being discriminated against,
because of that, let me go.
I will surely stand up for that person.
You know, what your research will give you?
30 years.
So, it's a good moment for you.
We saw in the down.
I'll ask them that if they were in a shoes,
and they were being bullied, and how would they feel?
Second of all, make them know that in our school,
we have rules and regulations,
girding bullying.
And suddenly, I can remind them of the number,
which was being given to all the students,
to call if anybody was being bullied.
Yes, I can't really remember when we were given the tone,
but if I check my daughter, I will see that number.
And I'll make an instant of this particular boy,
doing college, who was bullied to death.
Well, nice talking with you.
Thank you very much.
So, give this back to Deborah.
Okay?
