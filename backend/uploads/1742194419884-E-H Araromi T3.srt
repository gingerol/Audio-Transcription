1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
So can you tell me what you think about the story in the experience you had in

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
VR the last time you came?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I saw a man boy went to a box and all the students came to the abusing room.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the boy was a Hausa boy.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we were told that the Hausa boy is a Boko Haram.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the teacher came in and asked what the new student's name was.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They turned the name to Gary.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So what do you think about everything that happened?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Later in the box, in the box they told him to pick one bud.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He picked him and entered the class.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So later, they later do sports.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So they went one to one.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They told him that he cannot run, that he is a thing that he wants to run for life.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that was it.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So why do you think they did all of these things to him?

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because they want to show us.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Like the people in the school, why do you think they were treating him like that?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because he is a Hausa boy.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They are Boko Haram.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They used to feed a lot of people.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So what part of the story touched you the most?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I learned a lot of things.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I learned a lot of stories from him.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What part touched you the most?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Amongst all the things they did to him.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't like the way they treated him.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which particular things?

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hausa.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Like which particular type of treatment?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As they abused him.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The way they abused him?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That part touched you?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So how do you think he felt?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you put yourself in your reverse position, how do you feel about it?

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I felt so bad.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So when you were in the experience, it felt like it was you.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So since that time you had the experience in VR, can you tell me a story of how you have been relating with somebody from another tribe that is different from yours?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't understand what you are saying.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Have you had any interaction with people from another tribe that is different from yours?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you don't talk to people that are not from another tribe?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I talk to everybody.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hausa, Yoruba, I don't have a child.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So you relate to everybody?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So what has changed since you had that experience?

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like the things you learned, what have you been doing differently?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I learned good from the boy that they said Hausa.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I don't hear the Hausa too much.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because they tell them that they are Yoruba.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So you believe that they are Yoruba?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't believe Yoruba. I want to ask a person beside me.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You want to ask?

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Another person beside me. So I have not seen the Hausa. Maybe I was attracted. Is it true that you are Yoruba?

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So when you ask, you know that you are Yoruba?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Alright. So if you see somebody that is discriminated against or treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If I see...

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you see somebody being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will...

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will go away from them.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So you will leave the person that is discriminated against?

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because he is treated badly.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So if you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will go away from them.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You will go away from them?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
From the person that is treating them badly?

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The person that is treated badly.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You will go away from the person?

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why?

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because if you see somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If they are treating somebody badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Because this guy is being treated badly.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't understand.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You will feel bad.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why would you do that?

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will advise that person that he should go away from the person that is being treated badly.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why would you do that?

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because they are being treated badly.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't like the way that they are being treated badly.
