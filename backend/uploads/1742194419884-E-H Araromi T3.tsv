0	4560	So can you tell me what you think about the story in the experience you had in
4560	8000	VR the last time you came?
9000	16000	I saw a man boy went to a box and all the students came to the abusing room.
16000	19000	So the boy was a Hausa boy.
19000	29000	And we were told that the Hausa boy is a Boko Haram.
31000	43000	So the teacher came in and asked what the new student's name was.
43000	47000	They turned the name to Gary.
50000	54000	So what do you think about everything that happened?
55000	66000	Later in the box, in the box they told him to pick one bud.
68000	71000	He picked him and entered the class.
71000	74000	So later, they later do sports.
74000	78000	So they went one to one.
78000	87000	They told him that he cannot run, that he is a thing that he wants to run for life.
87000	90000	So that was it.
90000	93000	So why do you think they did all of these things to him?
93000	98000	Because they want to show us.
98000	104000	Like the people in the school, why do you think they were treating him like that?
104000	106000	Because he is a Hausa boy.
106000	109000	They are Boko Haram.
109000	112000	They used to feed a lot of people.
112000	115000	So what part of the story touched you the most?
125000	128000	I learned a lot of things.
128000	131000	I learned a lot of stories from him.
131000	134000	What part touched you the most?
134000	136000	Amongst all the things they did to him.
136000	139000	I don't like the way they treated him.
139000	142000	Which particular things?
142000	144000	Hausa.
144000	147000	Like which particular type of treatment?
147000	149000	As they abused him.
149000	150000	The way they abused him?
150000	151000	Yes.
151000	152000	That part touched you?
152000	153000	Yes.
153000	155000	So how do you think he felt?
155000	157000	If you put yourself in your reverse position, how do you feel about it?
157000	160000	I felt so bad.
160000	163000	So when you were in the experience, it felt like it was you.
163000	164000	Yes.
164000	174000	So since that time you had the experience in VR, can you tell me a story of how you have been relating with somebody from another tribe that is different from yours?
174000	176000	Yes.
176000	178000	I don't understand what you are saying.
178000	187000	Have you had any interaction with people from another tribe that is different from yours?
187000	188000	No.
188000	190000	So you don't talk to people that are not from another tribe?
190000	191000	No.
191000	192000	I talk to everybody.
192000	195000	Hausa, Yoruba, I don't have a child.
195000	197000	So you relate to everybody?
197000	198000	Yes.
198000	200000	So what has changed since you had that experience?
200000	205000	Like the things you learned, what have you been doing differently?
205000	212000	I learned good from the boy that they said Hausa.
212000	216000	So I don't hear the Hausa too much.
216000	220000	Because they tell them that they are Yoruba.
220000	222000	So you believe that they are Yoruba?
222000	226000	I don't believe Yoruba. I want to ask a person beside me.
226000	227000	You want to ask?
227000	235000	Another person beside me. So I have not seen the Hausa. Maybe I was attracted. Is it true that you are Yoruba?
235000	236000	Yes.
236000	239000	So when you ask, you know that you are Yoruba?
239000	240000	Yes.
241000	249000	Alright. So if you see somebody that is discriminated against or treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
249000	251000	If I see...
251000	256000	If you see somebody being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
256000	258000	I will...
262000	264000	I will go away from them.
266000	269000	So you will leave the person that is discriminated against?
270000	273000	Because he is treated badly.
281000	285000	So if you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
285000	287000	I will go away from them.
287000	288000	You will go away from them?
288000	289000	Yes.
289000	291000	From the person that is treating them badly?
291000	294000	The person that is treated badly.
294000	296000	You will go away from the person?
296000	297000	Yes.
297000	298000	Why?
298000	303000	Because if you see somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
303000	307000	If they are treating somebody badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
312000	316000	Because this guy is being treated badly.
316000	318000	I don't understand.
318000	327000	If you find somebody that is being treated badly because of their tribe, what would you do?
327000	329000	You will feel bad.
329000	331000	Why would you do that?
331000	339000	I will advise that person that he should go away from the person that is being treated badly.
339000	341000	Why would you do that?
341000	343000	Because they are being treated badly.
343000	346000	I don't like the way that they are being treated badly.
