WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So, can you tell me what you think about the story and the experience you had in VR?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
The last time we came here was...

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I think...

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I saw a man going on to a box

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And all the stuff that we were seeing

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
So the world was outside there

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
And the 13-inch is the outside light

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
And the outside voice

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And the vocalist...

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Okay.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
There was a music, so the touch I came in

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Now we are here at the New Year's training

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
So they say yes, what is the new student at Galba?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
They are on the name to guide you

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
So...

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
So what do you think about every single day?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
That time was...

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
In the box

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
They are swimming to pick them up

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And we came into the class

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So let's add a little bit of this box

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
So they want...

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
They want to learn

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
They are taught in the piano

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
And they are not...

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
That is...

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
That is...

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And they are taught in the piano

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
So what do you think about this story?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
What do you think about this story?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
You can't go into the shows

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And the people in the...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Those are the classmates of the school

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Why do you think they were treating like that?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Because they are always happy

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
They are vocalists who feel out of the piano

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
So what part of the story touched you?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I don't know, I learned this

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I learned a lot of stuff from me

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
What kind of touch you like?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You have it in the upper part of your piano

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't like the way they treat you

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Which part of the class is that?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I don't know

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
That which part of the class

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
That of the teachers

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
As they are using

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Yes, that part of the school

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
So how do you think that you put yourself in your class position?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I fell soon

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So when you were in that room

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You felt like you should do that

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So since that time you had the experience

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
In VR

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Can you tell me a story of how you are really seeing somebody from another

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That child is different from yours

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So that's that

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And we have any interaction

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
We have any relationship

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Interaction with people from another child

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
That is different

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't know

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
You know, I thought that you put them outside

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So you have to try

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So what has changed to you?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Can you add the experience?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Like the tissue lens?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
What are we doing to you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I learned

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I learned this from the girl that they say

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Dosa too

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I don't need a Dosa too

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't need a Dosa too

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't need a Dosa

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
You need a Dosa too

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't need a Dosa anymore

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I don't need a Dosa anymore

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
It's the notes that they say

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
So if you're not asking me or not

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
As I said, go and act

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That's what I mean

04:03.000 --> 04:03.500
You know, you see somebody

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
It's right here

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
When you say you see somebody, Nidasa

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
See, it's chive

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I see.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
This is somebody being cheated, but because of the choice.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
What would you do?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I really am.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I hope this is the product.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
I hope this is the product.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
So you really need to be cheated.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, because it's the cheetah factor.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
So if you find somebody that is not cheated by the pedestrian church, what would you do?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I will go with one little boy.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
You go with one little girl.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah, from the person who got cheated by the pedestrian church.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
The person that's cheated by the highway for the pedestrian church.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's always cheated by the pedestrian church.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Not for the roadmits.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh, he's actually cheating somebody on the street.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Because it's a church.

05:05.000 --> 05:27.000
If you find somebody that you find a situation where they actually use somebody but they are discriminates and they give you this because of the passing struggle.

05:27.000 --> 05:37.000
But all you do is I will provide that destination.

05:37.000 --> 05:47.000
But there is pity but I don't like the weather there is pity but I don't like the weather there is pity but
