Ayo, can you tell me what you think about this story in the experience you had in VR the last time we came?
Yes, it was. I don't know the name of the movie.
Ok, but what happened to the movie?
When I entered the movie, we entered the boss.
And we were going, we were going, we were going, and that's actually a click.
That she stopped, that's a cash store.
They would now come down, they would now go inside our class.
And then I click on something, and it's not moving.
They would click on it, sit down.
And I was there and I clicked it, and I was there.
And then I went in and I came to English.
We didn't go there, we didn't go there.
We didn't go to the library, we didn't go to the library.
And I was there, and I was there.
We moved there and I clicked it, and I said,
there was no one's fault.
And then I was there, and I was there.
Then I said, I can't run.
And I said, I can't run.
Then all of them said, no, I can't run.
And I make my formats into music.
Then I was crying, crying, crying.
Then I said, no, no.
So what do you think about it?
What do you think about it?
They are thinking that I cannot do anything.
Because I'm a flying man.
So what part of the story touched you the most?
My tip is that you were crying,
that you were making just of him like, I don't do anything.
So if you put yourself in the boys position,
how do you think he felt?
No, no.
Like if you were in the boys shoes, if it was you,
how will you feel?
Like I cannot even go back to that squeaking light.
They already bring it down to that.
I cannot do anything, nothing I can do.
So it made you feel bad.
Yes.
So have you had any...
Since the last time you had the experience in VR,
have you had any reason to interact with people from another tribe,
to friend from yours?
Can you tell me a story of everything that happened between you and somebody else from another tribe?
Like Ibu.
It used to be close,
like anything I wanted to cause fights between me,
they were going to set ourselves before the fight to kill me.
They are like more fighting, no trouble, nothing.
Yes, you guys will become close.
That's Ibu.
Okay, we have to have that experience.
Yes, me.
So do you experience me?
Yes.
He taught me how to...
Like...
He taught me to be close to different languages.
I cannot be...
I will not say like,
I'm one or no one, talk to another language.
Okay.
Alright.
So say...
If you see somebody that is really treated badly because of their tribe,
what would you do?
If I can help me, I will help you.
If you see somebody that is really treated badly because of their tribe,
what would you do?
I...
Is...
Over my power.
Is beyond my power.
I will...
Look for me, I will convince myself to help me.
Why would you do that?
Because...
So that you know I am...
Because so that I will meet you one time,
it can be my tone.
That is why.
